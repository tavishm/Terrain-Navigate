# Terrain Navigate Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating how to use the `terrain_navigate` library.

## Structure

*   **`MDRS/`**: Real-world workflow using data from the Mars Desert Research Station (or any USGS LAS data).
    *   Includes data downloading, processing, and pathfinding on real terrain.
*   **`synthetic/`**: Tutorials and demos using generated terrain.
    *   Best for learning the library, understanding cost functions, and visualization.

## Getting Started

If you are new to the library, start with **`synthetic/tutorial.ipynb`**.
If you want to work with real map data, go to **`MDRS/`**.
